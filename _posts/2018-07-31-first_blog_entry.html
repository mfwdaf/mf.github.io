	<h1>First Entry!</h1>
	<p>I have been working on getting Jekyll to work for hours, and I think I finally got it to work.  If this content actually posts, I will know for sure.  I have learned a few key takeaways from this exerience:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>The people in charge of these projects assume a ton of development skill.</li>
		<li>I do not have a ton of development skill :D</li>
		<li>Git is the most confsing thing I have ever worked with and I'm still not sure I have it figured out.</li>
		<li>Even creating a simple Jekyll page is not so much.</li>
	</ul>
	<p>I have been on this coding journey for several months now, and some of the best resources are 100% free.  However, I decided to purchase <strong>Colt Steele</strong>'s <em>Web Developer Bootcamp</em> and <strong>Andrei Neagoie</strong>'s <em>The Complete Web Developer in 2018: Zero to Mastery</em> from Udemy.  This decision was based on a blog post from <strong>codeburst.io</strong> about becoming a developer in 2018, and I found the advice to be helpful.  Both courses are good for their own reasons, but I like Colt's curriculum more, if only for the more personal feel of the examples, which include his dog, Rusty, and other relatable content.  Before beginning either course, I had joined <a href="https://www.freecodecamp.org"><strong>freeCodeCamp</strong></a> last year and I completed about 285 of the code challenges over the course of several months.  I experienced some personal hardships over the past year that prevented me from completing the course as I had originally intended, but I do have plans to fulfill that promise to myself.  At the time, I felt unprepared for the JavaScript examples, which is why I decided to diverge this year and take these two Udemy courses.</p>

	<p>The point of this blog is to catalog my journey as suggested by Scott Hanselman when interviewed by Soran from the <em>Code Newbie</em> podcast.  Plus, I really liked the idea he presented about reducing the amount of typing by creating repositories for your coding journey in the form of a blog and other media.</p>

	<p>So for now, I will continue with my journey, and I will set a reminder to blog once a week as I continue to grow my web development knowledge.</p>
